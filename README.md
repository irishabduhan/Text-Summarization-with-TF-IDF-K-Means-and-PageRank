## Project Overview

This project implements an extractive text summarization approach using multiple techniques, including TF-IDF, PageRank, Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), and K-Means clustering. The goal is to condense the information from a large document while maintaining the key ideas and relevant details.

The project processes a text file (`input.txt`), applies various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to create a concise summary, and outputs the result in `Summary_SentenceGraph.txt`.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
- **TF-IDF**: Computes term frequency-inverse document frequency for word relevance across sentences.
- **PageRank**: Ranks sentences by their importance based on cosine similarity.
- **MMR**: Ensures sentence diversity while maintaining relevance to the original text.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Clusters similar sentences for improved summarization.
- **Bigram-based Graph Sentence Generation**: Generates a summary sentence based on bigram relationships.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download NLTK resources**:
   Ensure that the required NLTK data packages are downloaded. You can run the following in your Python environment:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your input file in the same directory and name it `input.txt`.

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python summarization.py
   ```

3. After execution, the summary will be generated and saved as `Summary_SentenceGraph.txt`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Text Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Sentences are split into words.
- **Stopword Removal**: Common English stopwords are removed.
- **Lemmatization**: Words are reduced to their base forms (e.g., "running" to "run").

### 2. TF-IDF Calculation
Each sentence is represented as a vector based on TF-IDF scores of its words. These scores reflect how important a word is in a sentence relative to the rest of the document.

### 3. PageRank Calculation
Sentences are ranked using a similarity graph based on cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors. PageRank identifies the most important sentences.

### 4. Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)
MMR is used to balance between relevance (PageRank score) and diversity (similarity to already selected sentences). This ensures that the summary covers diverse aspects of the document.

### 5. K-Means Clustering
Sentences are grouped into clusters using K-means based on cosine similarity. Centroid sentences (most representative) from each cluster are selected for the summary.

### 6. Bigram-Based Graph Generation
A graph-based approach is applied using bigrams (pairs of consecutive words). The project constructs bigram graphs and uses them to generate meaningful summary sentences from clusters.

## Results

The generated summary condenses the original text into a much shorter version while keeping key information intact. Sentences are ranked and selected to ensure relevance and diversity using a combination of PageRank, MMR, and K-Means clustering.

## Future Work

- **Incorporate Sentence Semantics**: Use advanced techniques like BERT to improve sentence embeddings.
- **Dynamic Stopword Handling**: Use dynamic stopwords based on domain-specific vocabulary.
- **Summarization Evaluation**: Implement ROUGE or BLEU metrics to measure summary quality.
